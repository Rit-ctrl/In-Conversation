Why should you read this?\nTired answer:\nWe (you and me) have to figure that out\nWired answer:\nFirst thing - Thanks for taking your time to read this.\nI have been trying to figure out what truly interests me. On a random Monday it is Data Science. Before the day ends it is Cinema. And after I wake up it is Sports Analytics. But one thing has remained constant - my love for Strawberries.\nFigure from https://twitter.com/MadMenQtsBut on a serious note, I am starting this blog to articulate my thoughts and figuring out what works for me. I am trying to be more productive and hope this will keep me more accountable and honest. For you, I want this blog to be like a conversation with your friends about random things - the ones that run late into the night and forget when you wake up the next day - except this will be here for you to revisit and enjoy from time to time.\nSee you soon!\nRithic\n\n\n\n",
