Why should you read this?\r\nTired answer:\r\nWe (you and me) have to figure that out\r\nWired answer:\r\nFirst thing - Thanks for taking your time to read this.\r\nI have been trying to figure out what truly interests me. On a random Monday it is Data Science. Before the day ends it is Cinema. And after I wake up it is Sports Analytics. But one thing has remained constant - my love for Strawberries.\r\nFigure from https://twitter.com/MadMenQtsBut on a serious note, I am starting this blog to articulate my thoughts and figuring out what works for me. I am trying to be more productive and hope this will keep me more accountable and honest. For you, I want this blog to be like a conversation with your friends about random things - the ones that run late into the night and forget when you wake up the next day - except this will be here for you to revisit and enjoy from time to time.\r\nSee you soon!\r\nRithic\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
